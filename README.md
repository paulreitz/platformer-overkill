# Platformer Overkill

This is intended as a more extended version of the project built in this tutorial: https://stackabuse.com/phaser-3-and-tiled-building-a-platformer/

The original tutorial was intended to introduce a few concepts in a very simplistic way. This is to not over complicate things, not including any unnecessary code that might distract from the core ideas.

This repo presents the exact same project, but built in a more real world sense. In other words, it's a full project, with structured classes, interfaces, etc - with a full multi-environment build system. Basically the works.

This is why I called it *Platformer Overkill*. Setting up a full production ready project for a simple game like this is pretty much overkill. 

While there are a number of tutorials out there like the one linked above, there aren't any that explain what a more complete project would look like. This is only one way to structure a project. The exact way a project is structured is a combination of the needs of the project, and personal preference.

I am building this project in steps, with a pull request for each significant step. This will allow others (and myself TBH), to look at each step of the process, read the explanation for that step, and to see what changes were made to complete that particular step.
